# mandelbrot
Rust implementation of a Mandelbrot Set generator.

This implementation is taken from the book
[Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590/)
from Chapter 2 (Book implementation available online in the free preview).
I also made a couple minor modifications from the version presented in the book.
